# Password Generator
I was asked to create a password random generator.

##  Project Description
This project was my first attempt at using JavaScript. Besides class, I have never used JavaScript before and as of right now I find it really difficult. While defining variables makes sense, I have the hardest time understanding functions. I hope as I get more practice, I will be able to become better at this skill.

I'm happy with the way this turned out even though it's not perfect and could've been better. I am excited to keep learning and get better at something I'm not great at!
